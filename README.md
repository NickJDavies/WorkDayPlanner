# WorkDayPlanner
Homework week 5


GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

all of this is done.
Plus, the code is sorted out in the script section so that the hours can easily be changed, and everything will still work. If I had to add more to this site, I could make it so that the consumer can change what hours of the day are displayed, so that if they have different work hours to what is displayed then they can still change it.
